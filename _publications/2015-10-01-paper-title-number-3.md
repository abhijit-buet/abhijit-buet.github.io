Similar to low rank and sparse methods, that reconstruct images from
umdersampled k-space data, the Kernel Low Rank (KLR) also maps the data into a low dimensional embedding but unlike in low rank and sparse techniques, KLR applies a nonlinear transformation to define the new representation space and enforces low rankness in the kernel space.
