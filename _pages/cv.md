The reconstruction of MRI from undersampled data is ill-posed and results in aliased images. Similar to low rank and sparse methods, that reconstruct images from umdersampled k-space data, the Kernel Low Rank (KLR) also maps the data into a low dimensional embedding but unlike in low rank and sparse techniques, KLR applies a nonlinear transformation to define the new representation space and enforces low rankness in the kernel space. Our main contributions are : 1) Developed a Kernel Low Rank method
that do not require low-resolution images, 2) Acquired High Resolution ground truth data with several diffusion directions
and investigated the effect of i) undersampling in k-space only and ii) undersampling in both k-space and diffusion direction
for meniscus dMRI, 3) Studied the efficiency of Kernel-lowrank technique in meniscus diffusion MRI.
