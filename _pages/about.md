Hi, I am Abhijit. I am actually from Bangladesh. I have completed masters of science (MSc) in Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Before that, I have completed bachelor of science (BSc) in Electrical Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology(BUET). Currently, I am looking for Ph.D. positions.

My research interest lies broadly in the field of Computer vision and Deep learning and their applications, e.g., BioImaging, Health Informatics, Visual Question Answering, Deep Generative Models, Human-Computer Interaction. I also have a keen interest in some Natural Language Processing problems like sentiment extraction, social media analysis, Learning to Rank problems.

Projects
======
* <b> CVPR 2021 VizWiz Challenge (Visual Question Answering and Answerability)</b>:


* <b>SIIM ISIC Melanoma Classification 2020 </b>: The task required to predict from a patient’s dermatoscopy
information, whether the region is malignant or benign. The dataset contains dermatoscopy information of about
33,126 patients including images, age, gender, and other information. Trained a deep CNN architecture that uses
EfficientNet as a feature extractor. Both visual and meta-data features were fused in the final layers. Achieved an
accuracy of 87%(Top 20% on the Leaderboard).<b> <a href="https://github.com/abhijit-buet/SIIM-ISIC-Melanoma-Classification">Project Link</a> </b>

*<b> Tweet Sentiment Extraction </b>: The dataset contains 2,74,481 tweets and their corresponding sentiment. The task
required to propose a framework that would find out the key part of the sentence responsible for the sentiment.
Trained a pre-trained BERT model as a question-answering format and achieved a Jaccard score of 0.71(Top 18%
on the Leaderboard). Github

* <b> Nuclei Segmentation From Microscopic Images </b>: The task required to segment microscopic nuclei images.
The dataset contains 600 nuclei images for training. Trained a pre-trained U-NET and achieved a mean
IOU(intersection over union) of 0.52(Top 25%). Github

* <b> Continuous Emotion Prediction </b>: The task required to predict three emotion dimensions - Arousal, Valence and
Liking from audio, video, and text data of conversations. Proposed a Deep Multitask Learning framework using
Bidirectional LSTM-RNN and trained it on Bag-of-Words features. Achieved 10% improvement from the
baseline. Github
