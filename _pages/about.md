Hi, I am Abhijit. I am actually from Bangladesh. I have completed my masters of science(MSc) in Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Before that, I have completed bachelor of science(Bsc) in Electrical Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology(BUET). Currently, I am looking for PhD positions.

My research interest lies broadly in the field of Computer vision and Deep learning and their applications, e.g. BioImaging, Health Informatics, Visual Question Answering, Deep Generative Models, Human Computer Interaction. I also have keen interest in some Natural Language Processing problems like sentiment extraction, social media analysis, Learning to Rank problem.
