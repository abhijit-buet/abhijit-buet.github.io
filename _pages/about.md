Hi, I am Abhijit. I am actually from Bangladesh. I have completed masters of science (MSc) in Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Before that, I have completed bachelor of science (BSc) in Electrical Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology(BUET). Currently, I am looking for Ph.D. positions.

My research interest lies broadly in the field of Computer vision and Deep learning and their applications, e.g., BioImaging, Health Informatics, Visual Question Answering, Deep Generative Models, Human-Computer Interaction. I also have a keen interest in some Natural Language Processing problems like sentiment extraction, social media analysis, Information Retreival.

Projects
======
* <b> CVPR 2021 VizWiz Challenge (Visual Question Answering and Answerability)</b>: The VQA challenge is divided into two parts - i) Predicting the answer to a visual question, ii) Predicting whether a question can be answered or not. Visual features were extracted using a pretrained ResNet-152 and Input Questions are tokenized, embedded and encoded with an LSTM.
Visual features and encoded questions awere combined and used to create multiple attention maps over image features. The attended image features were fed to a classifier that outputs probabilities over the answers. The submission ranked 5th in the leaderboard. <b> <a href="https://github.com/abhijit-buet/VizWiz-Visua-Question-Answering-2021">Project Link</a> </b>


* <b> SIIM ISIC Melanoma Classification 2020 </b>: The task required to predict from a patient’s dermatoscopy
information, whether the region is malignant or benign. The dataset contains dermatoscopy information of about
33,126 patients including images, age, gender, and other information. Trained a deep CNN architecture that uses
EfficientNet as a feature extractor. Both visual and meta-data features were fused in the final layers. Achieved an
accuracy of 87%(Top 20% on the Leaderboard).<b> <a href="https://github.com/abhijit-buet/SIIM-ISIC-Melanoma-Classification">Project Link</a> </b>

* <b> Tweet Sentiment Extraction </b>: The dataset contains 2,74,481 tweets and their corresponding sentiment. The task
required to propose a framework that would find out the key part of the sentence responsible for the sentiment.
Trained a pre-trained BERT model as a question-answering format and achieved a Jaccard score of 0.71(Top 18%
on the Leaderboard). <b> <a href="https://github.com/abhijit-buet/Tweet-Sentiment-Extraction">Project Link</a> </b>

* <b> Nuclei Segmentation From Microscopic Images </b>: The task required to segment microscopic nuclei images.
The dataset contains 600 nuclei images for training. Trained a pre-trained U-NET and achieved a mean
IOU(intersection over union) of 0.52(Top 25%). <b> <a href="https://github.com/abhijit-buet/Nuclei-segmentation-from-microscopic-images">Project Link</a> </b>

* <b> Gesture Controlled Wheelchair </b>: We have created a Gesture Controlled Wheelchair that uses accelerometer to sense the movement direction from the hand of a disabled person. The signal was transmitted and received by a RF-pair transmitter-receiver and the wheelchair was controlled by an arduino according to the movement.
